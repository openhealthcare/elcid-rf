As a doctor I need to be able to see upstream trends.

Given that I am on the patient detail page.
Given that there is a WBC available for this patient (a link to check this is on the admin patient list view)
I should be shown a graph of their recent WBC tests in the trend panel.

Given that I have just added a patient who has lab tests but did not previously exist in elcid
I should be shown the lab test trends when they load in from upstream.
