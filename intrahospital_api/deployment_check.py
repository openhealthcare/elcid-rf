"""
Gets called by the deployment check management command.

check_since is the main method

Takes a datetime and looks at all patients who don't have archived tags.

Looks at all lab tests that have a last_updated after the datetime for those patients.

Then deletes them and runs a batch load since that time. Looks again.

Then deletes them and runs initial patient loads for all patients. Looks again.

The rolls back all changes in a transaction.

It populates a result dict with
current: The current state of the db.
batch_load: The result of the batch.
loadinitial_load: The result of the individual patient loads.

Next to each is a [obs number, lab test number, patient id] which
do not exist in at least one other load.
